I'm currently unemployed and was formerly working as a contractor at Nasa Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California as a Senior Linux Systems Administrator. I enrolled in the Online Bootcamp to upgrade my coding skills which will greatly assist me in landing my next position. My favorite movie is "The Sand Pebbles" (1966) starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, Candice Bergen.
