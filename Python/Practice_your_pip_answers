Assignment: Practice your pip
This short assignment will help you understand pip and get accustomed to using the commands required to use pip modules.

You will need to use your terminal to run these commands. Open up terminal, command prompt, or git bash to continue. 
Run them in the order instructed. Your assignment submission should be a .txt file that includes a short explanation 
of what you were able to learn about each command by doing a brief (1-2 min) web search for each term. If it is 
relevant, include the output of your command and your understanding of what it means. It is important to always 
read your terminal output and try to understand it.

Run the following commands:

pip install Django 
    # install the package Django

pip list
    # list currently installed packages

pip install Django (We know you already ran this one. What information do you see returned in terminal after this command?)
    # marki-mbp:Python marki$ pip install Django
    # Requirement already satisfied: Django in /anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    # Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from Django)

pip freeze (What's the difference between freeze and list?)
    # pip freeze uses a field separator of "==" to separate the version number from the package name
    # While pip list uses white space and () to contain the version number
    # pip freeze outputs installed packages in requirements format while pip list will not
    # if you're using virtualenv there's a file called requirements.txt that includes dependencies
    # In order for this to work your dependencies in the requirements.txt file was follow the requirements format

First cd into your Desktop directory (cd ~/Desktop), then run this command: pip freeze > requirements.txt. 
What do you see when you ls? What's inside this file?
    # marki-mbp:Python marki$ pip freeze > requirements.txt
    # marki-mbp:Python marki$ ls -la
    # total 8
    # drwxr-xr-x   4 marki  staff   136 Nov 26 13:20 .
    # drwxr-xr-x  13 marki  staff   442 Nov  7 11:02 ..
    # -rw-r--r--   1 marki  staff     0 Nov  4 15:38 about.txt
    # -rw-r--r--   1 marki  staff  2780 Nov 26 13:20 requirements.txt
    
    # pip freeze output has been redirected to the file requirements.txt
    # pip freeze output is in the file   
    
pip uninstall Django
    # uninstalls package Django

pip show Django
    # Nothing is returned
    # marki-mbp:Python marki$ pip show Django

pip search Flask. This one might take a moment to execute.
    # Returns the packages whose name or summary contains Flask
