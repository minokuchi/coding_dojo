I'm currently unemployed and was formerly working as a contractor at Nasa Ames Research Center in Mountain View, California as a Senior Linux Systems Administrator. I enrolled in the Online Bootcamp to upgrade my coding skills which will greatly assist me in landing my next position. My favorite book is "The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge" by Carlos Castaneda.
